Time Complexity Analysis:
- Each node is visited once: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

Space Complexity Analysis:
- Recursive function calls: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree (worst-case scenario).
- Stack space for recursion: O(h).
Overall: O(h)

Further Notes:
This algorithm recursively calculates the maximum path sum in a binary tree. It traverses the tree 
and calculates the maximum path sum for each node considering both left and right subtrees. The maximum 
path sum for a node is the maximum of its value and the sum of the maximum path sums of its children. 
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, and the space complexity 
is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree in the worst-case scenario.

TODO:
Another iteration of this problem is the Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
This problem tries to find the max path sum that mmay or may not include 
the root. More on this...
