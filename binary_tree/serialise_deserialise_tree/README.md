## **Problem Statement**

Serialize a given binary tree to a file and deserialize it back to a tree. Make sure that the original and the deserialized trees are identical.

    Serialize: Write the tree to a file.

    Deserialize: Read from a file and reconstruct the tree in memory.

Serialize the tree into a list of integers, and then, deserialize it back from the list to a tree. For simplicity’s sake, there’s no need to write the list to the files.


### Constraints

> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0,500].

> −1000 ≤ Node.value ≤ 1000
