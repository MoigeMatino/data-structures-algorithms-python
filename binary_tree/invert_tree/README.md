## **Problem Statement**

Given the root node of a binary tree, transform the tree by swapping each node’s left and right subtrees, thus creating a mirror image of the original tree. Return the root of the transformed tree.


### Constraints

> 0≤ Number of nodes in the tree ≤100≤100

> −1000 ≤ Node.value ≤ 1000
