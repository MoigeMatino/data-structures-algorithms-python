# Time Complexity: O(n)
# The algorithm runs in linear time because it involves three main steps: finding the middle of the list,
# reversing the second half, and comparing the two halves. Each of these steps requires a single pass through the list.

# Space Complexity: O(1)
# The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. It only uses a few pointer variables and does not require
# any additional data structures that depend on the size of the input list.

# Considerations:
# Since a palindrome reads the same forward and backward, an intuitive way to solve this problem is to use two pointersâ€”one placed at the beginning and 
# the other at the end. These pointers move toward the center, comparing the values at each step. While this approach is intuitive, it poses challenges 
# when working with singly linked lists. Singly linked lists only have the next pointers, so moving from the end toward the center requires additional steps. 
# To overcome this limitation, we solve this problem in three key steps: , , and If both halves of the list match, the linked list is a palindrome. 
# Here, reversing half the linked list allows us to use only the next pointers for comparison. 

# Approach:
# 1. Use the two-pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
# 2. Reverse the second half of the list.
# 3. Compare the first half and the reversed second half to check for palindrome properties.
# This approach efficiently determines if the list is a palindrome without using extra space for storing values.
