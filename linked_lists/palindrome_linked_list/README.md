## **Problem Statement**

Given the `head` of a linked list, your task is to check whether the linked list is a palindrome or not. Return `TRUE` if the linked list is a palindrome; otherwise, return `FALSE`.

**Note**: The input linked list prior to the checking process should be identical to the list after the checking process has been completed.


### Constraints
Let n be the number of nodes in a linked list.

> 1 ≤ n ≤ 500

> 0 ≤ Node.val ≤ 9.
