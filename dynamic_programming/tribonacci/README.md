# tribonacci

Write a function `tribonacci` that takes in a number argument, n, and returns the n-th number of the Tribonacci sequence.

The 0-th and 1-st numbers of the sequence are both 0.

The 2-nd number of the sequence is 1.

To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous three numbers.

Solve this recursively.

```python
tribonacci(0) # -> 0
```

```python
tribonacci(1) # -> 0
```

```python
tribonacci(2) # -> 1
```

```python
tribonacci(5) # -> 4
```

```python
tribonacci(7) # -> 13
```

```python
tribonacci(14) # -> 927
```

```python
tribonacci(20) # -> 35890
```

```python
tribonacci(37) # -> 1132436852
```
